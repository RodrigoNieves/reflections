When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

    When you want to collaborate with others, make public your code,to have
    access all the time to it, to have a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want trying a new feature and it could be possible that the 
    remote version is adding new feature that you are not using or worst 
    interfere with your code, so you don't want to pull until you have 
    completed what you want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

    * Fork is like a copy of a repository in GitHub, this are used to change
    the repository of someone else without affecting his repository.
    * Clone is a copy of a remote repository to a new repository, it is used
    when you want to work on another computer.
    * Branch is a label of a commit, a repository can have different branches,
    you can used as a different flows of the same project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can compare you version with the version of the remote and check each 
    one before merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

    Contacting someone by email, sending my code and explaining what is
    different. That is going to be harder, because is not easy to identify
    what is different and if the change is going to be conflicting with the
    main code.
