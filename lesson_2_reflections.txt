What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    I think that git create all the informtion is needed to manage a repository,
    such as the .git file.

How is the stagging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The working directory is all our files, because we not always want to have
    all files in our directory that is why we need something different. And
    the repository are our snapshots, but is necessary something in between to
    help us to select wich files are going to be commited, that is the staging
    area.
